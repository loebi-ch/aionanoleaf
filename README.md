# aionanoleaf
Replaces the not longer maintained aionanoleaf in home assistant

# Installation
As long Home Assistant does not include this package in their release, just place the folder "aionanoleaf" inside your Home Assistant's /config folder.
The aionanoleaf package in the config folder takes precedence over the aionanoleaf package installed with Home Assistant.
